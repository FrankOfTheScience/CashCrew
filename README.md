# CashCrew

## Object
This is a .NET Blazor App aimed to be launched on mainly Android and iOS devices.
The scope of this project is to create a not-so-classic expense manager app for travel groups.

I quote "not-so-classic" because instead of having a distribuited way to spend money group to automatically compensate, my app wants to manage the cash flows of groups where a "cashier" is elected and administrate the groups finances, gathering financial resources from partecipants of the trip and noting expenses and deposits.

## State of the Repo
I'd like you to be kind on this project, this is my first mobile app attempt and also I am new to MAUI & Blazor, as Frontend development in general since I am a backend dev and only know frontend summarily.

## Contribute
If you want to contribute just open a PR, help is very well accepted, specially in frontend and UI/UX design!
